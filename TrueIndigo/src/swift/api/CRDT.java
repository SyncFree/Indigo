/**
 * Operation-based CRDT object. An object can be optionally associated with a
 * transaction handle {@link TxnHandle} and clock {@link CausalityClock}. It
 * accepts three kind of operations:
 * <ol>
 * <li>application queries with no side-effects,</li>
 * <li>application updates with side-effects (only if associated with a handle),
 * </li>
 * <li>downstream updates with side-effects (only if not associated with a
 * handle).</li>
 * </ol>
 * Application update generates a downstream update {@link CRDTUpdate} using a
 * timestamp provided by a handle and registered in the handle. Downstream
 * update is eventually delivered exactly-once to other object instances in
 * causal order. Since the older of delivery of concurrent downstream updates
 * may be different on each replica, all concurrent updates must generate
 * donwstream updates that commute.
 * <p>
 * See {@link BaseCRDT} for more information on how to implement an object.
